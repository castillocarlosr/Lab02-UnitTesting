# Lab02-UnitTesting
Code Jan. 09, 2019


## Purpose:
This is a console run app to test a fake ATM for xUnit testing methods for Code401 C# .NET class.

##Summary
So this recreates a simple bank ATM within the console of Visual Studio 2017.
It will allow you to "view Balance", "deposit money", and "withdraw money".

There will try-catch-finally-throw methods implemented into the program.

### How to run the program:
This program requires visual studio.
Run the program to start the console application.
This will be under "Program.cs".

You may look at the source code to ensure nothing evil is in there.

* The console will ask five different questions that's fun and interesting about me.
* The console will display if your answer and if you guessed correctly.
* If you typed in invalid guess an Exception error will display showing you what the error was.
** example: How old am I?  If you type "birds" the console will tell you that you did not type in a valid number.
* When all 5 questions are answered, the console will display the number of correct guesses you made.

This assignment took about 4 hours to complete.  1 hour the night before and 3 hours during morning lab time.
