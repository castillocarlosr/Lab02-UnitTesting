# Lab02-UnitTesting
Code Jan. 09, 2019


## Purpose:
This is a console run app to test a fake ATM for xUnit testing methods for Code401 C# .NET class.

##Summary
So this recreates a simple bank ATM within the console of Visual Studio 2017.
It will allow you to "view Balance", "deposit money", and "withdraw money".

There will try-catch-finally-throw methods implemented into the program.

### How to run the program:
This program requires visual studio 2017.
Run the program to start the console application.
This will be under "Program.cs".

You may look at the source code to ensure nothing evil is in there.

* The console will welcome you to the ATM
* The console will display what options you want.  
*- Deposit, Withdraw, View Balance, or Exit.
* Your starting balance is $5000
* The ATM will not let you cheat by typing a negative number.
* Don't spend all your money at once.

This assignment took about 5 hours to complete.  1 hour the night before and 4 hours during morning lab time.
I kept forgetting things like the throw.
I couldn't get the test to pass, even though the code looked correct.

Got the code to pass eventually.  Just Re-Typed the same test.

Below are screen shots of what this should look like.
